# Fridge simulator

## Assumptions
- Air properties are constant
  - Mass of air is constant
    - Ignoring exchange of cold/ hot air when fridge is opened
    - Density is taken to be at the average of air at 12째C 1atm
  - Heat capacity of air is constant
- Rate of heat gain by fridge is constant
  - Temperature differential between fridge and outside is constant @ ~23deg째C (2째C and 25째C(rtp))
  - Estimates from [Experimental Evaluation of the Heat Transfer
Through the Walls of Household Refrigerators](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1501&context=iracc)
- Cooling for refrigerator system is constant when on
